# Machine-Evolution

A very simple machine learning algorithm that doesn't rely on any packages. It can be used as a universal algorithm, but currently it is set up to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. When run, the program will spend a few seconds going through hundreds of epochs to train itself to play the game.

The output of the program is a decision tree that shows how the program would play Rock, Paper, Scissors. For example, if the opponent were to play "Rock", the algorithm's decision tree would tell it to play "Paper" in order to win.
